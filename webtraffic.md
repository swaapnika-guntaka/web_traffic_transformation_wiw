## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the web traffic transformation problem and the solution implemented to address it. It is intended for developers, product managers, analysts, and engineering teams involved in web data processing.

---

## Problem Statement

The problem involves transforming web traffic data, stored in time-record format (CSV files), into a per-user format, where each row represents a different user, and the columns represent the time spent on each page visited. The data is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, and the primary objective is to convert this data into a single CSV file that is more accessible and suitable for analysis.

### Key Challenges
- Merging and transforming data from multiple CSV files.
- Handling changing root URLs for data ingestion.
- Ensuring data quality and schema consistency.
- Handling errors gracefully during data processing.

---

## Solution Overview

### Implementation Language
- The solution is implemented in Python 3.

### High-Level Steps
1. Data ingestion from Amazon S3.
2. Schema validation and mapping.
3. Data transformation using pandas DataFrame.
4. Writing the transformed data to an output CSV file.

---

## How to Use the Solution

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- AWS S3 access credentials configured.

### Running the Solution
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a `config.json` file with the desired root URL.
4. Run `web_traffic_transform.py` to process the data.
5. The transformed data will be saved in the `output` directory.

---

## Schema Management

- Schema versions can be managed using functions within the code.
- The code can adapt to schema changes as long as the schema mapping logic is updated.

---

## Error Handling

- Error handling is implemented to handle network errors during data download and data processing errors.
- Detailed error messages are logged for troubleshooting.

---

## Unit Tests

- Unit tests are available to verify the correctness of the solution.
- Tests cover different aspects of data processing, schema validation, and error handling.

---

## Performance Considerations

- The solution uses pandas DataFrames for data manipulation, which is efficient for moderate-sized datasets.
- For larger datasets, consider optimizing code or using distributed data processing frameworks.

---

## Scalability

- The solution can be scaled by running it on a distributed computing environment, leveraging cloud services or distributed computing frameworks.

---

## Monitoring and Production Support

- Logs are generated to track the execution and any errors.
- Monitoring tools can be integrated to track job performance in production.

---

## Data Quality Aspects

- Data quality checks are included in the `quality_checks.py` script.
- Checks can be added or modified as needed to ensure data quality.

---

## Future Proofing

- The solution is designed to be flexible, allowing changes to the root URL for data ingestion.
- Schema management allows for future schema changes.

---

## Best Practices

- Follow best practices for code quality, documentation, and error handling.
- Implement version control and code reviews.

---

## Functional Understanding

- Stakeholders should understand the problem domain, including web data formats, schema changes, and expected output.
- Collaboration with product managers, analysts, and engineering teams is essential.

---

## Impact to Changes

- Changes to the data source or schema may require updates to the code and schema management logic.
- Ensure version control and testing to handle changes effectively.
